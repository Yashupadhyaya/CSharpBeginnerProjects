   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Here are the NUnit test scenarios for the AnswerQuestion method in the GameState class:

Scenario 1: AnswerQuestion_WithCurrentQuestion_UpdatesGameState

Details:
  TestName: AnswerQuestionWithCurrentQuestionUpdatesGameState
  Description: This test verifies that when AnswerQuestion is called with a current question, the game state is updated correctly. It checks if the answered question is removed from unansweredQuestions, added to givenAnswers, and the IsCurrentQuestionAnswered and ChosenAnswer properties are set appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Create a new GameState instance with a list of QuizQuestion objects.
    - Set the CurrentQuestion property to a specific question.
    - Set the highlightedAnswerIndex to a valid index.
  Act:
    - Call the AnswerQuestion method.
  Assert:
    - Assert that the CurrentQuestion is removed from unansweredQuestions.
    - Assert that the CurrentQuestion and its corresponding answer are added to givenAnswers.
    - Assert that IsCurrentQuestionAnswered is set to true.
    - Assert that ChosenAnswer is set to the answer at the highlightedAnswerIndex.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the AnswerQuestion method correctly updates the game state when a current question is available. It verifies that the answered question is tracked properly and the relevant properties are updated to reflect the answered state.

Scenario 2: AnswerQuestion_WithNoCurrentQuestion_DoesNotUpdateGameState

Details:
  TestName: AnswerQuestionWithNoCurrentQuestionDoesNotUpdateGameState
  Description: This test verifies that when AnswerQuestion is called without a current question, the game state remains unchanged. It checks that unansweredQuestions, givenAnswers, IsCurrentQuestionAnswered, and ChosenAnswer are not modified.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a new GameState instance with a list of QuizQuestion objects.
    - Set the CurrentQuestion property to null.
  Act:
    - Call the AnswerQuestion method.
  Assert:
    - Assert that unansweredQuestions remains unchanged.
    - Assert that givenAnswers remains unchanged.
    - Assert that IsCurrentQuestionAnswered remains false.
    - Assert that ChosenAnswer remains null.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the AnswerQuestion method does not modify the game state when there is no current question. It verifies that the method gracefully handles the scenario where CurrentQuestion is null and does not cause any unexpected changes.

Scenario 3: AnswerQuestion_WithMultipleInvocations_UpdatesGameStateCorrectly

Details:
  TestName: AnswerQuestionWithMultipleInvocationsUpdatesGameStateCorrectly
  Description: This test verifies that multiple invocations of the AnswerQuestion method update the game state correctly. It checks that each answered question is removed from unansweredQuestions, added to givenAnswers, and the IsCurrentQuestionAnswered and ChosenAnswer properties are set appropriately for each invocation.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a new GameState instance with a list of QuizQuestion objects.
    - Set the CurrentQuestion property to a specific question.
    - Set the highlightedAnswerIndex to a valid index.
  Act:
    - Call the AnswerQuestion method multiple times, updating the CurrentQuestion and highlightedAnswerIndex between each invocation.
  Assert:
    - Assert that each answered question is removed from unansweredQuestions.
    - Assert that each answered question and its corresponding answer are added to givenAnswers.
    - Assert that IsCurrentQuestionAnswered is set to true after each invocation.
    - Assert that ChosenAnswer is set to the answer at the highlightedAnswerIndex for each invocation.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the AnswerQuestion method correctly updates the game state when called multiple times. It verifies that the method maintains the integrity of the game state across multiple invocations and tracks the answered questions accurately.

These test scenarios cover the main functionality of the AnswerQuestion method and validate its behavior under different conditions. They ensure that the method updates the game state correctly when a current question is available, handles the case when no current question is set, and maintains consistency across multiple invocations.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The code uses the System.Random class to generate random numbers for selecting the next question. However, System.Random is not a cryptographically secure random number generator and may produce predictable values, especially if instantiated with the same seed value.
Solution: For security-sensitive applications, consider using a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as System.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider or System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator, to generate unpredictable random numbers.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: The code retrieves quiz questions from a JSON file using the FileQuizQuestionSerializer class. If the JSON file contains sensitive information, such as answers or question details, and is not properly secured, it could be accessed by unauthorized users.
Solution: Ensure that the JSON file containing quiz questions is stored in a secure location with appropriate access controls. Consider encrypting sensitive data within the JSON file and decrypting it only when needed. Implement proper file permissions and access restrictions to prevent unauthorized access to the JSON file.
