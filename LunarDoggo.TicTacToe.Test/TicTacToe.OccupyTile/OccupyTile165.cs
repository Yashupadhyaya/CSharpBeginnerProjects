   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test for successful tile occupation
Details:
  TestName: TestSuccessfulTileOccupation
  Description: This test is meant to check if a tile can be successfully occupied by a player. It is a basic functionality of the game.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game state and a valid ButtonTileMapping object.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with the created mapping.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to check if the tile is occupied.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the successful occupation of the tile. This is important to ensure the players can occupy tiles as part of the game.

Scenario 2: Test for tile already occupied
Details:
  TestName: TestTileAlreadyOccupied
  Description: This test is meant to check if the game handles the scenario where a player tries to occupy a tile that's already occupied.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game state and a ButtonTileMapping object that corresponds to an already occupied tile.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with the created mapping.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to check if the TileAlreadyOccupied event is invoked.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the game correctly handles the scenario of a tile already being occupied. This is important to maintain the integrity of the game rules.

Scenario 3: Test for player winning the game
Details:
  TestName: TestPlayerWinsGame
  Description: This test is meant to check if the game can correctly identify when a player has won.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game state in a way that the current player is one move away from winning.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with a mapping that should result in the current player winning.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to check if the GameOverPlayerWon event is invoked.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the game correctly identifies a winning condition and ends the game. This is critical for the game to function properly.

Scenario 4: Test for game ending in a draw
Details:
  TestName: TestGameEndsInDraw
  Description: This test is meant to check if the game can correctly identify when it has ended in a draw.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game state in a way that the game board is fully occupied without a winner.
  Act: Call the OccupyTile method with any mapping (it shouldn't matter since the board is already fully occupied).
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to check if the GameOverDraw event is invoked.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the game correctly identifies a draw condition and ends the game. This is important to ensure the game can correctly handle all end conditions.
