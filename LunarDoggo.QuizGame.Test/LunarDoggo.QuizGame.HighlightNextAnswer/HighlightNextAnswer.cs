   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: HighlightNextAnswer Test for Normal Flow

Details:
    TestName: HighlightNextAnswerNormalFlow
    Description: This test is meant to check if the HighlightNextAnswer method accurately increments the highlightedAnswerIndex by 1 when the method is called.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a GameState object with a list of QuizQuestions. Ensure that at least one QuizQuestion has more than one answer.
    Act: Call the HighlightNextAnswer method.
    Assert: Check if the highlightedAnswerIndex has been incremented by 1.
Validation:
    This assertion verifies if the HighlightNextAnswer method correctly changes the highlighted answer to the next one. The expected result is that the highlightedAnswerIndex is incremented by 1. This is significant in ensuring that the user can navigate through the possible answers for a quiz question.

Scenario 2: HighlightNextAnswer Test for Edge Case

Details:
    TestName: HighlightNextAnswerEdgeCase
    Description: This test is meant to check if the HighlightNextAnswer method resets the highlightedAnswerIndex to 0 when the end of the answers list is reached.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a GameState object with a list of QuizQuestions. Ensure that the highlightedAnswerIndex is set to the last index of the Answers array of the CurrentQuestion.
    Act: Call the HighlightNextAnswer method.
    Assert: Check if the highlightedAnswerIndex has been reset to 0.
Validation:
    This assertion verifies if the HighlightNextAnswer method correctly resets the highlighted answer to the first one when the end of the list is reached. The expected result is that the highlightedAnswerIndex is reset to 0. This is significant in ensuring that the user can loop through the possible answers for a quiz question.

Scenario 3: HighlightNextAnswer Test with No CurrentQuestion

Details:
    TestName: HighlightNextAnswerNoCurrentQuestion
    Description: This test is meant to check if the HighlightNextAnswer method handles the scenario where there is no CurrentQuestion set in the GameState.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a GameState object with no QuizQuestions. 
    Act: Call the HighlightNextAnswer method.
    Assert: Check if any exceptions are thrown.
Validation:
    This assertion verifies if the HighlightNextAnswer method can handle cases where there is no current question. The expected result is that no exceptions are thrown. This is significant in ensuring that the application can handle cases where no questions are available.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper input validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The provided code does not contain any form of input validation. This could lead to unexpected behavior or potential security vulnerabilities if the input data is malformed or malicious.
Solution: Implement input validation checks to ensure that the input data is in the expected format and within the expected range. This can be done using conditional statements or regular expressions.

Vulnerability: Insecure Randomness (CWE-330)
Issue: The code uses System.Random for generating random numbers, which is not suitable for generating cryptographically secure random numbers. This could be exploited by an attacker to predict the outcome of the random number generator.
Solution: Replace System.Random with a more secure alternative such as System.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider for generating cryptographically secure random numbers.

Vulnerability: Null Reference (CWE-476)
Issue: The code does not check for null values before calling methods on objects. This could lead to NullReferenceException errors which could disrupt the execution of the application.
Solution: Perform null checks before calling methods on objects. This can be done using the null conditional operator (?.) in C#.

Vulnerability: Path Traversal (CWE-22)
Issue: The path for the game_questions.json file is hard-coded. If the file is not found at the specified location, this could lead to a FileNotFoundException.
Solution: Use a more flexible approach for file handling. Consider asking the user for the file location or use a configuration file to specify the file path.
