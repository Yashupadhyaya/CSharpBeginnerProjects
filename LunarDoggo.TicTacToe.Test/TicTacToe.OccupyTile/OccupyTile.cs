   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test to check if the OccupyTile method correctly assigns a tile to a player.

Details:
    TestName: TestOccupyTileAssignsTileToPlayer.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the OccupyTile method correctly assigns a tile to a player when the tile is not already occupied.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Player instance and the GameBoard instance. Ensure the tile at coordinates (x, y) is not occupied.
    Act: Call the OccupyTile method with the Player instance and coordinates (x, y).
    Assert: Check if the tile at coordinates (x, y) is now occupied by the Player's Id.
Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the OccupyTile method correctly assigns a tile to a player. The expected result is based on the method's requirement to assign a tile to a player if it is not already occupied.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the OccupyTile method correctly returns false when a tile is already occupied.

Details:
    TestName: TestOccupyTileReturnsFalseIfTileOccupied.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the OccupyTile method correctly returns false when trying to assign a tile that is already occupied.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Player instance and the GameBoard instance. Ensure the tile at coordinates (x, y) is already occupied.
    Act: Call the OccupyTile method with the Player instance and coordinates (x, y).
    Assert: Check if the return value of the OccupyTile method is false.
Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the OccupyTile method correctly returns false when trying to assign a tile that is already occupied. The expected result is based on the method's requirement to not assign a tile to a player if it is already occupied.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the OccupyTile method correctly invokes the PlayerOccupiedTile event.

Details:
    TestName: TestOccupyTileInvokesPlayerOccupiedTileEvent.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the OccupyTile method correctly invokes the PlayerOccupiedTile event when a tile is successfully occupied by a player.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Player instance and the GameBoard instance. Set up an event handler for the PlayerOccupiedTile event. Ensure the tile at coordinates (x, y) is not occupied.
    Act: Call the OccupyTile method with the Player instance and coordinates (x, y).
    Assert: Check if the PlayerOccupiedTile event was invoked.
Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the OccupyTile method correctly invokes the PlayerOccupiedTile event when a tile is successfully occupied by a player. The expected result is based on the method's requirement to trigger the event when a tile is occupied.
