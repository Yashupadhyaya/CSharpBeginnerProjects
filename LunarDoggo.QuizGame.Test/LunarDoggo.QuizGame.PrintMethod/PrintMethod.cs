   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Here are the test scenarios for the PrintMethod in the LunarDoggo.QuizGame namespace:

Scenario 1: VerifyPrintMethodWritesExpectedOutput

Details:
  TestName: VerifyPrintMethodWritesExpectedOutput
  Description: This test verifies that the PrintMethod writes the expected output to the console.

Execution:
  Arrange: Redirect the console output to a StringWriter to capture the written text.
  Act: Invoke the PrintMethod.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to compare the captured console output against the expected string "jst in case".

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the PrintMethod correctly writes the hardcoded string to the console output.
  This test ensures that the method behaves as intended and doesn't introduce any unexpected changes to the output.

Scenario 2: VerifyPrintMethodDoesNotThrowException

Details:
  TestName: VerifyPrintMethodDoesNotThrowException
  Description: This test verifies that the PrintMethod does not throw any exceptions during execution.

Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is required.
  Act: Invoke the PrintMethod within an NUnit Assert.DoesNotThrow block.
  Assert: Use NUnit's Assert.DoesNotThrow to ensure that no exception is thrown during the method execution.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the PrintMethod can be executed without throwing any exceptions.
  This test ensures the stability and reliability of the method, confirming that it doesn't introduce any unexpected exceptions.

Scenario 3: VerifyPrintMethodDoesNotModifyGlobalState

Details:
  TestName: VerifyPrintMethodDoesNotModifyGlobalState
  Description: This test verifies that the PrintMethod does not modify any global state or have side effects beyond writing to the console.

Execution:
  Arrange: Capture the initial state of any relevant global variables or objects.
  Act: Invoke the PrintMethod.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to compare the captured initial state with the state after the method execution.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the PrintMethod does not introduce any unintended side effects or modifications to global state.
  This test ensures that the method adheres to the principle of not modifying global state and maintains the integrity of the application.

Note: Given the simplicity of the PrintMethod, which only writes a hardcoded string to the console, there are limited test scenarios that can be generated. The provided scenarios cover the basic functionality and behavior of the method.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The 'filePath' variable in the 'GetQuestions' method of the 'Program' class is constructed using a relative path '.\game_questions.json'. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the file path and access files outside the intended directory if the application accepts user-supplied input for constructing the file path.
Solution: Use the 'Path.Combine' method with a validated or hardcoded base directory to construct the file path instead of directly concatenating the file name to the current directory. Validate and sanitize any user-supplied input used in file path construction.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The 'DeserializeQuestions' method of the 'FileQuizQuestionSerializer' class (assumed to be defined in the 'LunarDoggo.QuizGame.IO' namespace) is used to deserialize the quiz questions from a JSON file. If the deserialization process is not properly secured and the input JSON is not validated, it could lead to deserialization attacks, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code or perform other malicious activities.
Solution: Implement proper input validation and sanitization before deserializing the JSON data. Use a secure JSON deserialization library that provides built-in protection against deserialization vulnerabilities. Consider using data transfer objects (DTOs) or whitelisting to restrict the types that can be deserialized.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The 'DrawQuizQuestion' method of the 'ConsoleVisualizer' class directly outputs the 'Question' property of the 'QuizQuestion' object using 'Console.WriteLine' without any input validation or encoding. If the question text contains any malicious scripts or HTML tags, it could potentially lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability if the output is rendered in a web-based environment.
Solution: Implement proper input validation and output encoding techniques to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. Encode or escape any untrusted data before rendering it in the output. Use a well-established encoding library or framework that provides built-in XSS protection.
