   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test for Single Question Loaded

Details:
  TestName: TestSingleQuestionLoaded
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the 'DrawGameStart' method when only a single question is loaded.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'totalQuestionCount' to 1.
  Act: Invoke 'DrawGameStart' method with the set 'totalQuestionCount'.
  Assert: Check if the output of the Console matches the expected string saying "1 question was loaded, press \"enter\" to start the game."

Validation:
  This test verifies that the 'DrawGameStart' method correctly handles the scenario of a single question being loaded. It's important to confirm that the method can handle scenarios with different numbers of questions, including the edge case of only one question.

Scenario 2: Test for Multiple Questions Loaded

Details:
  TestName: TestMultipleQuestionsLoaded
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the 'DrawGameStart' method when multiple questions are loaded.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'totalQuestionCount' to a number greater than 1.
  Act: Invoke 'DrawGameStart' method with the set 'totalQuestionCount'.
  Assert: Check if the output of the Console matches the expected string saying "{totalQuestionCount} questions were loaded, press \"enter\" to start the game."

Validation:
  This test verifies that the 'DrawGameStart' method correctly handles the scenario of multiple questions being loaded. This is a common scenario, so it's crucial to ensure that the method can handle it correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for No Questions Loaded

Details:
  TestName: TestNoQuestionsLoaded
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the 'DrawGameStart' method when no questions are loaded.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'totalQuestionCount' to 0.
  Act: Invoke 'DrawGameStart' method with the set 'totalQuestionCount'.
  Assert: Check if the output of the Console matches the expected string saying "0 questions were loaded, press \"enter\" to start the game."

Validation:
  This test verifies that the 'DrawGameStart' method correctly handles the scenario of no questions being loaded. It's important to confirm that the method can handle scenarios with different numbers of questions, including the edge case of zero questions.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate user inputs when asking for 'Reload game?' and 'Do you like to play again?'. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior or errors if the user enters something other than 'Y' or 'N'.
Solution: Validate user inputs using a simple if-statement or a switch-case block to ensure the application behaves as expected regardless of the user input.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The code reveals internal system details through error messages. For example, 'No questions were loaded, please enter some questions into the json file in the applications folder.' This information could be used by an attacker to gain more knowledge about the system and launch further attacks.
Solution: Avoid revealing system details in error messages. Instead, log these details for debugging purposes and present the user with a generic error message.

Vulnerability: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input
Issue: The code does not check the size of the input when displaying the quiz question and its answers. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the input exceeds the console's buffer size.
Solution: Check the size of the input before displaying it on the console. If the input exceeds the console's buffer size, truncate it or display it in chunks.
