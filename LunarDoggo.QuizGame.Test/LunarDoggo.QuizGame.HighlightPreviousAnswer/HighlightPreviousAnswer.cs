   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: HighlightPreviousAnswer Test for Normal Flow

Details:
    TestName: HighlightPreviousAnswerNormalFlow
    Description: This test is to verify that the HighlightPreviousAnswer method works as expected when it is called in a normal flow, i.e., when there are multiple answers and the highlighted answer is not the first one.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the GameState class with a list of QuizQuestions, each having multiple QuizQuestionAnswers. Ensure the highlighted answer is not the first one.
    Act: Call the HighlightPreviousAnswer method.
    Assert: Check if the highlighted answer changes to the previous one.
Validation:
    The assertion verifies whether the highlighted answer successfully changes to the previous one after the HighlightPreviousAnswer method is called. This is expected as per the game logic that allows the player to navigate through different answers.

Scenario 2: HighlightPreviousAnswer Test for Edge Case

Details:
    TestName: HighlightPreviousAnswerEdgeCase
    Description: This test is to verify that the HighlightPreviousAnswer method works as expected when it is called in an edge case, i.e., when the highlighted answer is the first one.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the GameState class with a list of QuizQuestions, each having multiple QuizQuestionAnswers. Ensure the highlighted answer is the first one.
    Act: Call the HighlightPreviousAnswer method.
    Assert: Check if the highlighted answer changes to the last one.
Validation:
    The assertion verifies whether the highlighted answer successfully changes to the last one after the HighlightPreviousAnswer method is called. This is expected as per the game logic that allows the player to loop through the answers.

Scenario 3: HighlightPreviousAnswer Test for Error Handling

Details:
    TestName: HighlightPreviousAnswerErrorHandling
    Description: This test is to verify that the HighlightPreviousAnswer method works as expected when it is called in an exceptional situation, i.e., when there are no QuizQuestionAnswers.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the GameState class with a list of QuizQuestions, each having no QuizQuestionAnswers.
    Act: Call the HighlightPreviousAnswer method.
    Assert: Check if the method throws an exception.
Validation:
    The assertion verifies whether the method throws an exception when there are no QuizQuestionAnswers. This is expected as per the error handling mechanism that should prevent the application from crashing in such situations.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Randomness (CWE-330)
Issue: The 'Random' class in System namespace is used, which does not generate truly random numbers and can be predicted, leading to potential security issues.
Solution: Replace the 'Random' class with a more secure random number generator, such as 'RNGCryptoServiceProvider' in System.Security.Cryptography namespace.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (CWE-79)
Issue: The code does not seem to validate or sanitize user input before using it, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if this input gets rendered in a web page.
Solution: Ensure that all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized before using. Consider using libraries like Microsoft's AntiXSS library.

Vulnerability: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release (CWE-404)
Issue: It appears that the code does not properly manage system resources. If an exception occurs during the execution of the code, the system resources might not be released properly. This could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
Solution: Use 'try-finally' blocks or 'using' statements to ensure that system resources are properly released, even if an exception occurs.

Vulnerability: Path Traversal (CWE-22)
Issue: The file path to 'game_questions.json' is hardcoded and relative. If the application is deployed in a different environment or if the directory structure changes, the application may not function as expected.
Solution: Consider using configuration files or environment variables to store file paths, which can be changed as per the deployment environment without changing the code.
