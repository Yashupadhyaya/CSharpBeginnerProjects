   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Here are the test scenarios for the MoveToNextQuestion() method in the LunarDoggo.QuizGame namespace:

Scenario 1: Moving to the next question when unanswered questions exist

Details:
  TestName: MoveToNextQuestionWithUnansweredQuestions
  Description: This test verifies that the MoveToNextQuestion method correctly selects a random unanswered question from the available pool and updates the game state accordingly when there are unanswered questions.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Create an instance of GameState with a list of QuizQuestion objects.
    - Ensure that there are unanswered questions in the GameState.
  Act: 
    - Invoke the MoveToNextQuestion method on the GameState instance.
  Assert:
    - Assert that the CurrentQuestion property is not null.
    - Assert that the IsCurrentQuestionAnswered property is set to false.
    - Assert that the highlightedAnswerIndex is reset to 0.
    - Assert that the ChosenAnswer property is set to null.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the MoveToNextQuestion method correctly selects a random unanswered question and updates the game state properties. It validates that the game can progress to the next question when there are available unanswered questions.

Scenario 2: Moving to the next question when no unanswered questions exist

Details:
  TestName: MoveToNextQuestionWithNoUnansweredQuestions
  Description: This test verifies that the MoveToNextQuestion method does not modify the game state when there are no unanswered questions available.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create an instance of GameState with an empty list of QuizQuestion objects or ensure that all questions have been answered.
  Act:
    - Invoke the MoveToNextQuestion method on the GameState instance.
  Assert:
    - Assert that the CurrentQuestion property remains unchanged (null or the last answered question).
    - Assert that the IsCurrentQuestionAnswered property remains unchanged.
    - Assert that the highlightedAnswerIndex remains unchanged.
    - Assert that the ChosenAnswer property remains unchanged.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the MoveToNextQuestion method does not modify the game state when there are no unanswered questions available. It validates that the game does not progress or change its state in this scenario.

Scenario 3: Moving to the next question after answering the current question

Details:
  TestName: MoveToNextQuestionAfterAnsweringCurrentQuestion
  Description: This test verifies that the MoveToNextQuestion method correctly selects the next unanswered question and resets the relevant properties after the current question has been answered.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create an instance of GameState with a list of QuizQuestion objects.
    - Ensure that there are unanswered questions in the GameState.
    - Answer the current question using the AnswerQuestion method.
  Act:
    - Invoke the MoveToNextQuestion method on the GameState instance.
  Assert:
    - Assert that the CurrentQuestion property is not null and different from the previously answered question.
    - Assert that the IsCurrentQuestionAnswered property is set to false.
    - Assert that the highlightedAnswerIndex is reset to 0.
    - Assert that the ChosenAnswer property is set to null.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the MoveToNextQuestion method correctly selects the next unanswered question and resets the relevant properties after the current question has been answered. It validates that the game progresses to the next question seamlessly.

These test scenarios cover the main functionality and edge cases of the MoveToNextQuestion method. They ensure that the method behaves correctly when there are unanswered questions, when there are no unanswered questions, and after answering the current question. The scenarios validate the game state transitions and property updates based on the available questions and the current state of the game.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The code uses System.Random to generate random indexes for selecting the next question. However, System.Random is not cryptographically secure and may produce predictable values, especially if the seed is known or guessable. This could potentially allow an attacker to predict the order of questions.
Solution: Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as System.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider, to generate random indexes for selecting questions. This ensures that the generated values are sufficiently random and unpredictable.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The code uses a FileQuizQuestionSerializer to deserialize quiz questions from a JSON file. Deserializing untrusted data can lead to security vulnerabilities if the deserialized objects are not properly validated or if the deserialization process allows the execution of arbitrary code. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious JSON file to exploit this vulnerability.
Solution: Implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques when deserializing quiz questions from external sources. Use a secure deserialization library that provides built-in protection against deserialization attacks, such as JSON.NET with TypeNameHandling.None. Additionally, validate the deserialized objects to ensure they meet the expected schema and constraints before using them in the application.
