   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Validate the Console Output Message

Details:
  TestName: TestDrawNoQuestionsConsoleOutput.
  Description: This test aims to validate that the DrawNoQuestions() method provides the correct console output message.

Execution:
  Arrange: No specific data or dependencies need to be arranged for this test.
  Act: Call the DrawNoQuestions() method.
  Assert: Check that the console output message matches the expected message.

Validation:
  The assertion is meant to verify that the console output message from the DrawNoQuestions() method is accurate. This is important to ensure that the user receives the correct instructions when there are no questions loaded.

Scenario 2: Validate Console Output when No Questions are Loaded

Details:
  TestName: TestDrawNoQuestionsWithNoQuestionsLoaded.
  Description: This test aims to validate that the DrawNoQuestions() method is called and provides the correct console output message when no questions are loaded.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the game state to simulate a scenario where no questions are loaded.
  Act: Call the DrawNoQuestions() method.
  Assert: Check that the console output message matches the expected message and that the method was called.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the DrawNoQuestions() method is invoked and it provides the correct console output message when no questions are loaded. This is significant for ensuring that the application behaves as expected in this scenario.

Scenario 3: Validate Console Output when User Inputs Yes to Reload

Details:
  TestName: TestDrawNoQuestionsWithUserInputYes.
  Description: This test aims to validate that the DrawNoQuestions() method responds appropriately when the user inputs 'Y' to reload the game.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user input to simulate a scenario where the user inputs 'Y' to reload the game.
  Act: Call the DrawNoQuestions() method.
  Assert: Check that the game reloads as expected.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the DrawNoQuestions() method responds correctly to the user input 'Y'. This is significant for ensuring that the application behaves as expected in this scenario.

Scenario 4: Validate Console Output when User Inputs No to Reload

Details:
  TestName: TestDrawNoQuestionsWithUserInputNo.
  Description: This test aims to validate that the DrawNoQuestions() method responds appropriately when the user inputs 'N' to not reload the game.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user input to simulate a scenario where the user inputs 'N' to not reload the game.
  Act: Call the DrawNoQuestions() method.
  Assert: Check that the game does not reload and ends as expected.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the DrawNoQuestions() method responds correctly to the user input 'N'. This is significant for ensuring that the application behaves as expected in this scenario.

Scenario 5: Validate Console Output when User Inputs Invalid Response

Details:
  TestName: TestDrawNoQuestionsWithInvalidUserInput.
  Description: This test aims to validate that the DrawNoQuestions() method responds appropriately when the user inputs an invalid response to the reload prompt.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user input to simulate a scenario where the user inputs an invalid response to the reload prompt.
  Act: Call the DrawNoQuestions() method.
  Assert: Check that the method responds with an appropriate error message.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the DrawNoQuestions() method responds correctly to an invalid user input. This is significant for ensuring that the application behaves as expected in this scenario.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate user input when asking to reload the game or to play again. This can potentially lead to unhandled exceptions if the user provides unexpected input.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the user provides an expected response (e.g., 'Y' or 'N').

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The code reveals the correct answer when the user provides an incorrect answer. This could potentially lead to information exposure if the questions or answers are sensitive.
Solution: Consider the sensitivity of the information before revealing the correct answer. If the information is sensitive, avoid revealing it through error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-398: Indicator of Poor Code Quality
Issue: The code uses string concatenation for building messages which can lead to poor performance if the number of concatenations is large.
Solution: Use StringBuilder for building strings instead of concatenating strings using the '+' operator.
