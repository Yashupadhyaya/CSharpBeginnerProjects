   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test to check if the method works when there are unanswered questions

Details:
  TestName: TestMoveToNextQuestionWhenHasUnansweredQuestions
  Description: This test will verify if the MoveToNextQuestion method works properly when there are unanswered questions. It should assign a random question from the unanswered questions list to the CurrentQuestion property, set the IsCurrentQuestionAnswered property to false, reset the highlightedAnswerIndex to 0 and set the ChosenAnswer to null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the GameState object with a list of unanswered questions.
  Act: Invoke the MoveToNextQuestion method.
  Assert: Check if the CurrentQuestion property has been assigned a question from the unanswered questions list, the IsCurrentQuestionAnswered property is false, the highlightedAnswerIndex is 0 and the ChosenAnswer is null.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly updates the properties when there are unanswered questions. This is essential for the game to continue to the next question.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method does nothing when there are no unanswered questions

Details:
  TestName: TestMoveToNextQuestionWhenNoUnansweredQuestions
  Description: This test will verify if the MoveToNextQuestion method does nothing when there are no unanswered questions. It should leave the properties unchanged.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the GameState object with an empty list of unanswered questions.
  Act: Invoke the MoveToNextQuestion method.
  Assert: Check if the CurrentQuestion property remains unchanged, the IsCurrentQuestionAnswered property remains unchanged, the highlightedAnswerIndex remains unchanged and the ChosenAnswer remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method does not change any properties when there are no unanswered questions. This is essential for maintaining the state of the game when all questions have been answered.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method selects a random question from the unanswered questions list

Details:
  TestName: TestMoveToNextQuestionRandomness
  Description: This test will verify if the MoveToNextQuestion method selects a random question from the unanswered questions list. It should not always select the first question in the list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the GameState object with a list of unanswered questions.
  Act: Invoke the MoveToNextQuestion method multiple times.
  Assert: Check if the CurrentQuestion property is assigned different questions from the unanswered questions list over multiple invocations of the method.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method is correctly randomizing the selection of the next question. This is essential for ensuring the unpredictability of the game.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Randomness (CWE-330)
Issue: The `Random` class in .NET is not cryptographically secure and can be predicted after observing a few outputs. This can lead to potential cheating in a quiz game scenario.
Solution: Replace usage of `System.Random` with a more secure alternative such as `RNGCryptoServiceProvider`.

Vulnerability: Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The code does not validate the input questions and their answers. Malformed input could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Add validation checks for inputs. Ensure that each question has at least one correct answer and no duplicate answers.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)
Issue: The application appears to be a console application and might not be vulnerable to XSS. However, if this code were repurposed for a web application, it could become vulnerable if the questions or answers include malicious scripts.
Solution: If repurposing for a web application, use a secure method to encode the output to prevent XSS attacks.
