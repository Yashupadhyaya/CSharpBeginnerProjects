   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test if Reset method resets the board correctly

Details:
  TestName: TestResetMethodFunctionality
  Description: This test is meant to check if the Reset method resets all tiles on the board to 0, ensuring that the board is ready for a new game.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game board with some tiles occupied by players.
  Act: Invoke the Reset method.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to compare the actual state of every tile on the board with the expected state (which is 0).

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the Reset method correctly resets all tiles on the board to 0. This is crucial as it ensures that the game board is correctly cleared and ready for a new game.

Scenario 2: Test if Reset method works correctly after multiple invocations

Details:
  TestName: TestResetMethodMultipleInvocations
  Description: This test is meant to check if the Reset method still works correctly after being invoked multiple times.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game board with some tiles occupied by players.
  Act: Invoke the Reset method multiple times.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to compare the actual state of every tile on the board with the expected state (which is 0).

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the Reset method can correctly reset the game board even after being invoked multiple times. This is crucial as it ensures that the game board is correctly cleared and ready for a new game, regardless of how many times the Reset method has been invoked.

Scenario 3: Test if Reset method works correctly when no tiles are occupied

Details:
  TestName: TestResetMethodWithNoOccupiedTiles
  Description: This test is meant to check if the Reset method works correctly when no tiles on the board are occupied.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game board with no tiles occupied by players.
  Act: Invoke the Reset method.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to compare the actual state of every tile on the board with the expected state (which is 0).

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the Reset method works correctly even when no tiles on the board are occupied. This is crucial as it ensures that the game board can be reset successfully regardless of its initial state.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The methods 'OccupyTile' and 'IsTileOccupied' in the GameBoard class do not validate the input parameters. This could lead to an IndexOutOfRangeException if a caller passes in a value that is outside the expected range (0-2).
Solution: Add checks at the start of these methods to ensure that the input parameters are within the expected range. Throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException if they are not.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-639)
Issue: The game state is directly manipulated through the 'OccupyTile' method, which could allow a malicious user to modify the game state in an unauthorized way.
Solution: Instead of directly manipulating the game state, consider implementing a command pattern. This would involve creating a command object that encapsulates a request to the game state as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The 'HasWon' method in the GameBoard class exposes information about the underlying implementation of the game board. This could provide an attacker with valuable information that could be used to reverse engineer the game logic.
Solution: Consider refactoring the 'HasWon' method to reduce the amount of information it exposes. One possibility could be to return a simple boolean value indicating whether the game has been won, without revealing which player has won.
