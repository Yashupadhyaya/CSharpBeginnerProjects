   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Here are the NUnit test scenarios for the DrawAnswerStatus method in the ConsoleVisualizer class:

Scenario 1: DrawAnswerStatus_CorrectAnswer_DisplaysCorrectMessage

Details:
  TestName: DrawAnswerStatus_CorrectAnswer_DisplaysCorrectMessage
  Description: This test verifies that when the answer is correct, the method displays the appropriate message indicating the answer is correct and prompts the user to continue with "enter".
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ConsoleVisualizer and a QuizQuestionAnswer object with a sample answer.
  Act: Call the DrawAnswerStatus method with the correct parameter set to true and the QuizQuestionAnswer object.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to verify that the console output contains the expected message: "Your answer is correct. Continue with \"enter\"."
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the correct message is displayed when the answer is correct.
  This test is important to validate that the user receives proper feedback for a correct answer and is prompted to continue.

Scenario 2: DrawAnswerStatus_IncorrectAnswer_DisplaysIncorrectMessageWithCorrectAnswer

Details:
  TestName: DrawAnswerStatus_IncorrectAnswer_DisplaysIncorrectMessageWithCorrectAnswer
  Description: This test verifies that when the answer is incorrect, the method displays the appropriate message indicating the answer is incorrect, provides the correct answer, and prompts the user to continue with "enter".
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ConsoleVisualizer and a QuizQuestionAnswer object with a sample correct answer.
  Act: Call the DrawAnswerStatus method with the correct parameter set to false and the QuizQuestionAnswer object.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to verify that the console output contains the expected message: "Your answer isn't correct. The correct answer is: \"<correctAnswer>\". Continue with \"enter\".", where <correctAnswer> is the answer from the QuizQuestionAnswer object.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the incorrect message is displayed along with the correct answer when the user's answer is incorrect.
  This test is crucial to validate that the user receives accurate feedback for an incorrect answer and is provided with the correct answer for learning purposes.

Scenario 3: DrawAnswerStatus_NullCorrectAnswer_ThrowsArgumentNullException

Details:
  TestName: DrawAnswerStatus_NullCorrectAnswer_ThrowsArgumentNullException
  Description: This test verifies that when the correctAnswer parameter is null, the method throws an ArgumentNullException.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ConsoleVisualizer.
  Act: Call the DrawAnswerStatus method with the correct parameter set to false and the correctAnswer parameter set to null.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to verify that an ArgumentNullException is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method properly handles the case when the correctAnswer parameter is null and throws an appropriate exception.
  This test is important to validate that the method has proper error handling and fails gracefully when provided with invalid input.

These test scenarios cover the main functionality of the DrawAnswerStatus method, including displaying the correct message for a correct answer, displaying the incorrect message with the correct answer for an incorrect answer, and handling the case when the correctAnswer parameter is null.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The code directly outputs user-supplied data from the 'QuizQuestionAnswer' object without proper validation or encoding. If the 'Answer' property contains untrusted data, it could lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when rendered in a web context.
Solution: Implement proper input validation and output encoding for user-supplied data. Use a well-established encoding library or built-in methods to sanitize the 'Answer' property before displaying it. Ensure that any HTML or JavaScript special characters are properly encoded to prevent XSS attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The code mentions loading questions from a JSON file in the application's folder. If the file path is constructed using user-supplied input without proper validation, it could lead to a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker could potentially access files outside the intended directory.
Solution: Validate and sanitize any user-supplied input used to construct file paths. Use a whitelist approach to restrict file access to a specific directory. Avoid using user-supplied input directly in file paths. Instead, map user input to predefined file names or use a secure file handling library that provides path traversal protection.
