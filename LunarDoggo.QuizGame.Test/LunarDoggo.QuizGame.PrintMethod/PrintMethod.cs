   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Validate PrintMethod Output

Details:
  TestName: ValidatePrintMethodOutput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the PrintMethod is correctly writing to the Console. The specific functionality being tested is the Console.WriteLine method, and the target scenario is when PrintMethod is called.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock Console.WriteLine to capture its output.
  Act: Invoke PrintMethod.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to compare the captured console output against the expected string "jst in case".

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the output of PrintMethod matches "jst in case". The expected result is based on the PrintMethod's implementation. This test is significant because it ensures that the method is correctly outputting to the console.

Scenario 2: Validate PrintMethod Exception Handling

Details:
  TestName: ValidatePrintMethodExceptionHandling
  Description: This test is meant to check if PrintMethod handles exceptions thrown by Console.WriteLine. The specific functionality being tested is exception handling, and the target scenario is when Console.WriteLine throws an exception.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock Console.WriteLine to throw an exception when called.
  Act: Invoke PrintMethod.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to verify that no exceptions propagate out of PrintMethod.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that PrintMethod does not allow exceptions to propagate. The expected result is based on the principle of least surprise; methods should handle their exceptions when possible. This test is significant because it ensures that the method is robust against errors in its dependencies.

Scenario 3: Validate PrintMethod Multiple Calls

Details:
  TestName: ValidatePrintMethodMultipleCalls
  Description: This test is meant to check if multiple calls to PrintMethod write to the Console correctly. The specific functionality being tested is the Console.WriteLine method, and the target scenario is when PrintMethod is called multiple times.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock Console.WriteLine to capture its output.
  Act: Invoke PrintMethod multiple times.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to compare the captured console output against the expected string "jst in case" repeated the number of times PrintMethod was called.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the output of multiple calls to PrintMethod matches "jst in case" repeated. The expected result is based on the PrintMethod's implementation. This test is significant because it ensures that the method can be called multiple times without issues.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The 'Random' class in C# is not suitable for generating secure random numbers as it is predictable, especially in the 'MoveToNextQuestion' method in the 'GameState' class where it is used to select the next question. If an attacker can predict the sequence of questions, they can potentially gain an unfair advantage.
Solution: Use a more secure method of generating random numbers, such as the 'RNGCryptoServiceProvider' class, which is specifically designed for generating cryptographically secure random numbers.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: In the 'DrawAnswerStatus' method in the 'ConsoleVisualizer' class, detailed error messages are printed to the console when an incorrect answer is chosen. This could potentially expose sensitive information about the correct answer to an attacker.
Solution: Error messages should not reveal sensitive information. Consider revising the error messages to be more generic and less revealing.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: In the 'GetQuestions' method in the 'Program' class, the file path for the game questions is hardcoded and relative. This could potentially allow an attacker to read files outside of the intended directory by manipulating the file path.
Solution: Ensure that the application properly restricts which files can be accessed. One way to do this is to use a whitelist of allowed paths and filenames, and deny all other access attempts.
