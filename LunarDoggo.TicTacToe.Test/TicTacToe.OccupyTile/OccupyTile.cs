   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test if OccupyTile method returns false when the tile is already occupied

Details:
  TestName: TestOccupyTileWhenTileIsOccupied
  Description: This test will check if the OccupyTile method returns false when the tile is already occupied by another player.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a player and occupy a tile.
  Act: Try to occupy the same tile with a new player.
  Assert: Check if the method returns false.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies when a tile is already occupied and therefore cannot be occupied by a new player. This is important to ensure the integrity of the game rules.

Scenario 2: Test if OccupyTile method returns true when the tile is not occupied

Details:
  TestName: TestOccupyTileWhenTileIsNotOccupied
  Description: This test will check if the OccupyTile method returns true when the tile is not occupied.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a player.
  Act: Try to occupy a tile that is not occupied.
  Assert: Check if the method returns true.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies when a tile is not occupied and therefore can be occupied by a player. This is important to ensure the integrity of the game rules.

Scenario 3: Test if OccupyTile method correctly assigns the player's Id to the tile

Details:
  TestName: TestOccupyTileAssignsPlayerId
  Description: This test will check if the OccupyTile method correctly assigns the player's Id to the tile.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a player and occupy a tile.
  Act: Retrieve the Id of the player assigned to the tile.
  Assert: Check if the Id matches the Id of the player who occupied the tile.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly assigns the player's Id to the tile. This is important to track which player has occupied which tile.

Scenario 4: Test if OccupyTile method triggers the PlayerOccupiedTile event when a tile is successfully occupied

Details:
  TestName: TestOccupyTileTriggersEvent
  Description: This test will check if the OccupyTile method triggers the PlayerOccupiedTile event when a tile is successfully occupied.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a player and an event handler for PlayerOccupiedTile event.
  Act: Occupy a tile and check if the event is triggered.
  Assert: Check if the event handler was invoked.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method triggers the PlayerOccupiedTile event when a tile is successfully occupied. This is important for notifying other parts of the application about the state change.

Scenario 5: Test if OccupyTile method handles out of bound coordinates correctly

Details:
  TestName: TestOccupyTileWithOutOfBoundsCoordinates
  Description: This test will check if the OccupyTile method handles out of bound coordinates correctly.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a player.
  Act: Try to occupy a tile with coordinates that are outside the valid range.
  Assert: Check if an appropriate exception is thrown.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method handles out of bound coordinates correctly by throwing an exception. This is important to prevent unexpected behavior or errors in the application.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The methods that receive input parameters (e.g., OccupyTile method in the GameBoard class) do not validate the input. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if invalid input is provided.
Solution: Add input validation to all methods that receive parameters. Ensure that the input matches the expected format and range. For example, check that the x and y parameters in the OccupyTile method are between 0 and 2 (inclusive).

Vulnerability: Error Handling
Issue: The code does not appear to have robust error handling. In real-world applications, it's important to handle potential errors and exceptions to prevent the application from crashing and to provide a good user experience.
Solution: Implement try/catch blocks where appropriate to catch potential exceptions and handle them gracefully. Log exceptions for debugging purposes.
