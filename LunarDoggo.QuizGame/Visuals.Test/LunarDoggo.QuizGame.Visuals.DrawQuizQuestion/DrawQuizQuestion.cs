   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Here are the NUnit test scenarios for the DrawQuizQuestion method in the ConsoleVisualizer class:

Scenario 1: DrawQuizQuestion_WithValidQuestionAndHighlightedAnswer

Details:
  TestName: DrawQuizQuestionWithValidQuestionAndHighlightedAnswer
  Description: This test verifies that the DrawQuizQuestion method correctly displays the question and answers, with the highlighted answer marked with an asterisk.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a QuizQuestion object with a valid question and answers.
    - Select one of the answers as the highlighted answer by setting its Id.
  Act:
    - Call the DrawQuizQuestion method with the created QuizQuestion and the highlighted answer's Id.
  Assert:
    - Assert that the console output contains the question text.
    - Assert that each answer is displayed on a separate line.
    - Assert that the highlighted answer is marked with an asterisk.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the question and answers are displayed correctly, and the highlighted answer is visually distinguished. This test is important to verify that the user is presented with the correct information and can easily identify the currently selected answer.

Scenario 2: DrawQuizQuestion_WithEmptyQuestionText

Details:
  TestName: DrawQuizQuestionWithEmptyQuestionText
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the DrawQuizQuestion method when the question text is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a QuizQuestion object with an empty question text and valid answers.
    - Select one of the answers as the highlighted answer by setting its Id.
  Act:
    - Call the DrawQuizQuestion method with the created QuizQuestion and the highlighted answer's Id.
  Assert:
    - Assert that the console output does not contain any question text.
    - Assert that each answer is still displayed on a separate line.
    - Assert that the highlighted answer is marked with an asterisk.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method handles an empty question text gracefully and does not display any unexpected content. The answers should still be displayed correctly, even if the question text is missing.

Scenario 3: DrawQuizQuestion_WithNoAnswers

Details:
  TestName: DrawQuizQuestionWithNoAnswers
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the DrawQuizQuestion method when there are no answers provided for the question.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a QuizQuestion object with a valid question text but an empty list of answers.
    - Set the highlighted answer Id to a non-existent Id.
  Act:
    - Call the DrawQuizQuestion method with the created QuizQuestion and the non-existent highlighted answer Id.
  Assert:
    - Assert that the console output contains the question text.
    - Assert that no answers are displayed.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method handles the scenario where no answers are available for the question. It should display the question text but not attempt to display any answers, avoiding any potential exceptions or unexpected behavior.

Scenario 4: DrawQuizQuestion_WithNullQuestion

Details:
  TestName: DrawQuizQuestionWithNullQuestion
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the DrawQuizQuestion method when a null QuizQuestion object is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Set the QuizQuestion object to null.
    - Set the highlighted answer Id to any valid or invalid Id.
  Act:
    - Call the DrawQuizQuestion method with the null QuizQuestion and the highlighted answer Id.
  Assert:
    - Assert that an ArgumentNullException is thrown with an appropriate message.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method handles a null QuizQuestion object by throwing an ArgumentNullException. This test is important to verify that the method fails gracefully and provides a clear indication of the error when an invalid input is provided.

Scenario 5: DrawQuizQuestion_WithNonExistentHighlightedAnswer

Details:
  TestName: DrawQuizQuestionWithNonExistentHighlightedAnswer
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the DrawQuizQuestion method when the highlighted answer Id does not match any of the available answers.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Create a QuizQuestion object with a valid question and answers.
    - Set the highlighted answer Id to a non-existent Id.
  Act:
    - Call the DrawQuizQuestion method with the created QuizQuestion and the non-existent highlighted answer Id.
  Assert:
    - Assert that the console output contains the question text.
    - Assert that each answer is displayed on a separate line.
    - Assert that no answer is marked with an asterisk.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method handles the scenario where the highlighted answer Id does not match any of the available answers. It should display the question and answers correctly but not highlight any answer with an asterisk.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the DrawQuizQuestion method, including valid inputs, edge cases, and error handling. They ensure that the method behaves as expected and provides a reliable user interface for displaying quiz questions and answers.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The 'DrawQuizQuestion' method outputs the 'question.Question' property directly to the console without sanitizing it first. If the question text comes from an untrusted source like a file or user input, it could contain malicious JavaScript or HTML that gets executed when displayed.
Solution: Validate and sanitize the 'question.Question' value before writing it to the console. Use 'HtmlEncoder.Default.Encode()' or similar to safely encode any untrusted data.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The 'DrawNoQuestions' method instructs the user to add questions to a JSON file in the application's folder. If the file path used to load questions is constructed based on user input without validation, it could allow an attacker to traverse to sensitive system directories.
Solution: When loading questions from a file, use a predefined static path. If file paths must include user input, validate and sanitize the supplied path, and use 'Path.GetFullPath()' to resolve relative paths before opening the file.
