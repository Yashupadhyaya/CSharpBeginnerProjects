   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test to check when all fields are occupied

Details:
  TestName: TestAllFieldsOccupied
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method AreAllFieldsOccupied correctly returns true when all the tiles on the TicTacToe game board are occupied.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a GameBoard instance and occupy all tiles using the OccupyTile method.
  Act: Invoke the AreAllFieldsOccupied method.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns true.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly detects when all fields on the game board are occupied. The expected result is true because all tiles on the game board have been occupied in the Arrange step. This test is significant as it validates the correct functioning of the game board's ability to detect a full board, which is a key requirement for determining the end of a game in TicTacToe.

Scenario 2: Test to check when not all fields are occupied

Details:
  TestName: TestNotAllFieldsOccupied
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method AreAllFieldsOccupied correctly returns false when not all the tiles on the TicTacToe game board are occupied.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a GameBoard instance and occupy some (but not all) tiles using the OccupyTile method.
  Act: Invoke the AreAllFieldsOccupied method.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly detects when not all fields on the game board are occupied. The expected result is false because not all tiles on the game board have been occupied in the Arrange step. This test is significant as it validates the correct functioning of the game board's ability to detect an ongoing game where there is still space for moves.

Scenario 3: Test to check when no fields are occupied

Details:
  TestName: TestNoFieldsOccupied
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method AreAllFieldsOccupied correctly returns false when none of the tiles on the TicTacToe game board are occupied.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a GameBoard instance without occupying any tiles.
  Act: Invoke the AreAllFieldsOccupied method.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly detects when no fields on the game board are occupied. The expected result is false because no tiles on the game board have been occupied in the Arrange step. This test is significant as it validates the correct functioning of the game board's ability to detect the start of a game.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated User Input
Issue: The method OccupyTile(Player player, int x, int y) in the GameBoard class accepts user input without any validation. This can lead to out-of-bound array access if the user provides a value for x or y that is outside of the expected range (0-2).
Solution: Add checks at the beginning of the OccupyTile method to ensure that the values of x and y are within the expected range.

Vulnerability: Information Disclosure
Issue: The method HasWon(byte player) in the GameBoard class is public and could be used by malicious users to check the game's internal state. This could lead to cheating by revealing information about the other player's moves.
Solution: Change the access modifier of the HasWon method to private or internal to prevent access from outside the GameBoard class.

Vulnerability: Lack of Input Sanitization
Issue: In the OnPlayerWon method in the MainWindow class, the Player ID is directly inserted into a message box without any sanitization. Although the current code does not allow for any malicious usage, as the Player ID is a byte and not a string, it's a good practice to sanitize all user inputs.
Solution: Ensure that all user inputs are sanitized before they are used. In this case, as the Player ID is a byte, there is no direct vulnerability, but it's a good practice to keep in mind for future code development.
