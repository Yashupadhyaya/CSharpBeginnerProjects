   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test to check if the game is finished when there are no unanswered questions

Details:
  TestName: TestGameFinishesWhenNoUnansweredQuestions
  Description: This test is meant to check if the game finishes when there are no unanswered questions left.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock GameState to return false for HasUnansweredQuestions.
  Act: Call the DoTick() method.
  Assert: Check if the IsFinished property of the class GameLoop is set to true.

Validation:
  This test verifies that the game correctly identifies when there are no more unanswered questions, and sets the IsFinished property to true. This is important to ensure the game ends when all questions have been answered.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the game continues when there are unanswered questions

Details:
  TestName: TestGameContinuesWhenUnansweredQuestionsExist
  Description: This test is meant to check if the game continues when there are unanswered questions left.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock GameState to return true for HasUnansweredQuestions.
  Act: Call the DoTick() method.
  Assert: Check if the IsFinished property of the class GameLoop is set to false.

Validation:
  This test verifies that the game correctly identifies when there are more unanswered questions, and sets the IsFinished property to false. This is important to ensure the game continues while there are still questions to be answered.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the UpdateScreen method is called

Details:
  TestName: TestUpdateScreenMethodIsCalled
  Description: This test is meant to check if the UpdateScreen method is called in the DoTick method.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock methods and properties as required.
  Act: Call the DoTick() method.
  Assert: Check if the UpdateScreen() method was called.

Validation:
  This test verifies that the DoTick method correctly calls the UpdateScreen method. This is important to ensure the game screen is updated at each tick of the game loop.

Scenario 4: Test to check if the ProcessInput method is called

Details:
  TestName: TestProcessInputMethodIsCalled
  Description: This test is meant to check if the ProcessInput method is called in the DoTick method.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock methods and properties as required.
  Act: Call the DoTick() method.
  Assert: Check if the ProcessInput() method was called.

Validation:
  This test verifies that the DoTick method correctly calls the ProcessInput method. This is important to ensure the game processes user input at each tick of the game loop.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The PrintMethod() in both NewClass and OldClass writes arbitrary string to the console. This can potentially expose sensitive information if the method is inadvertently used for debugging or error messages.
Solution: Avoid writing sensitive information to the console. Ensure that no sensitive data is being printed to the console in production version of the code.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The ProcessInput() method in the GameLoop class does not validate the input from the Console.ReadKey() method. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if an unhandled key is pressed.
Solution: Add a default case to the switch statement in the ProcessInput() method to handle unexpected input. This will improve the robustness of the input handling.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: In the UpdateScreen() method, there is a potential for a NullReferenceException if the CurrentQuestion or HighlightedAnswer properties of the state object are null.
Solution: Add null checks before accessing properties of CurrentQuestion or HighlightedAnswer. Ensure that these objects are properly initialized before being used.
