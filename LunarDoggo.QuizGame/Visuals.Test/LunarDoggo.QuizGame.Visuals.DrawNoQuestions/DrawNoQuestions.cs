   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Here are the NUnit test scenarios for the DrawNoQuestions method in the ConsoleVisualizer class:

Scenario 1: DrawNoQuestions_Outputs_CorrectMessage

Details:
  TestName: DrawNoQuestionsOutputsCorrectMessage
  Description: This test verifies that the DrawNoQuestions method outputs the correct message to the console when no questions are loaded.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the ConsoleVisualizer class.
  Act: Invoke the DrawNoQuestions method.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to verify that the console output matches the expected message.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the console output is exactly "No questions were loaded, please enter some questions into the json file in the applications folder.\n\nReload game? (Y/N)".
  This test ensures that the user is properly informed about the absence of questions and prompted to reload the game.

Scenario 2: DrawNoQuestions_Sets_CursorVisible_To_False

Details:
  TestName: DrawNoQuestionSetsCursorVisibleToFalse
  Description: This test verifies that the DrawNoQuestions method sets the Console.CursorVisible property to false.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the ConsoleVisualizer class.
  Act: Invoke the DrawNoQuestions method.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to verify that Console.CursorVisible is set to false after the method execution.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if Console.CursorVisible is false after calling DrawNoQuestions.
  Setting CursorVisible to false is important to maintain a clean user interface and prevent the cursor from being visible during the game.

Scenario 3: DrawNoQuestions_Does_Not_Throw_Exception

Details:
  TestName: DrawNoQuestionsDoesNotThrowException
  Description: This test verifies that the DrawNoQuestions method does not throw any exceptions during execution.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the ConsoleVisualizer class.
  Act: Invoke the DrawNoQuestions method.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to verify that no exceptions are thrown during the method execution.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the DrawNoQuestions method completes without throwing any exceptions.
  This test ensures the stability and reliability of the method, confirming that it handles the scenario of no questions gracefully without causing any unexpected errors.

These test scenarios cover the core functionality of the DrawNoQuestions method, including the correct console output, setting the CursorVisible property, and ensuring exception-free execution. They help validate the behavior of the method in the context of the quiz game application.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The 'DrawQuizQuestion' method directly outputs the 'question.Question' property to the console without proper validation or encoding. If the question data is user-controlled or contains untrusted input, it could potentially include malicious scripts or HTML tags, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when displayed in a web context.
Solution: Implement proper input validation and output encoding for any data that is displayed to the user. Use a well-tested encoding library or built-in encoding functions provided by the framework to safely encode user-supplied data before outputting it to the console or any other output medium.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The 'DrawNoQuestions' method suggests loading questions from a JSON file in the application's folder. If the file path is constructed using untrusted user input without proper validation, it could lead to a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker could potentially manipulate the file path to access sensitive files outside the intended directory.
Solution: Validate and sanitize any user-supplied file paths or names before using them to access files. Ensure that the file path is properly restricted to the intended directory and does not contain any directory traversal sequences (e.g., '../'). Consider using built-in file path handling functions provided by the framework to safely construct file paths.
