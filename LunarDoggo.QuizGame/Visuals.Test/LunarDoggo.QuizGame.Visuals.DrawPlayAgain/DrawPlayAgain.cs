   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Here are the NUnit test scenarios for the DrawPlayAgain() method in the LunarDoggo.QuizGame.Visuals namespace:

Scenario 1: DrawPlayAgain_WritesCorrectPromptToConsole

Details:
  TestName: DrawPlayAgain_WritesCorrectPromptToConsole
  Description: This test verifies that the DrawPlayAgain method writes the correct prompt to the console, asking the user if they want to play again with the options "Y" for yes and "N" for no.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the ConsoleVisualizer class.
  Act: Call the DrawPlayAgain method on the ConsoleVisualizer instance.
  Assert: Use a mocking framework or console output capturing technique to assert that the console output contains the expected prompt text: "Do you like to play again? (Y/N)".
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the DrawPlayAgain method correctly prompts the user to play again with the appropriate options.
  This test is important to validate that the user is presented with the correct prompt and options to continue or exit the game.

Scenario 2: DrawPlayAgain_DoesNotThrowException

Details:
  TestName: DrawPlayAgain_DoesNotThrowException
  Description: This test ensures that the DrawPlayAgain method does not throw any exceptions when called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the ConsoleVisualizer class.
  Act: Call the DrawPlayAgain method on the ConsoleVisualizer instance.
  Assert: Use NUnit's Assert.DoesNotThrow to verify that no exception is thrown during the execution of the DrawPlayAgain method.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the DrawPlayAgain method can be called without causing any exceptions.
  This test helps to identify any unexpected behavior or potential issues in the method implementation.

Scenario 3: DrawPlayAgain_DoesNotModifyConsoleProperties

Details:
  TestName: DrawPlayAgain_DoesNotModifyConsoleProperties
  Description: This test verifies that the DrawPlayAgain method does not modify any console properties, such as the cursor position or visibility.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the ConsoleVisualizer class. Store the initial values of relevant console properties (e.g., cursor position, visibility).
  Act: Call the DrawPlayAgain method on the ConsoleVisualizer instance.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to compare the console properties after calling DrawPlayAgain with the initial values stored in the Arrange step. Assert that the properties remain unchanged.
Validation:
  The assertions ensure that the DrawPlayAgain method does not have any unintended side effects on the console properties.
  This test helps to maintain the integrity of the console state and prevents any unexpected behavior in the user interface.

Note: The provided test scenarios assume the availability of a mocking framework or a technique to capture and assert console output. The actual implementation of the tests may vary based on the chosen testing framework and project setup.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The 'DrawQuizQuestion' method writes the 'question.Question' property directly to the console output without proper encoding or validation. If the question text comes from an untrusted source like a JSON file, it could contain malicious JavaScript code leading to XSS.
Solution: Implement proper input validation and output encoding for any data written to the console. Use 'HtmlEncoder.Default.Encode(question.Question)' to safely encode the question text before writing it.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The 'DrawNoQuestions' method suggests loading questions from a JSON file in the application's folder. If the file path is constructed using untrusted input, it could be vulnerable to path traversal attacks, allowing access to sensitive files outside the intended directory.
Solution: Validate and sanitize any file paths constructed from user input. Use 'Path.GetFullPath' to resolve relative paths and ensure they are within the application's base directory before accessing the JSON file.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'DrawPlayAgain' and 'DrawNoQuestions' methods read user input from the console without any validation. Unexpected input could lead to unhandled exceptions or incorrect program flow.
Solution: Implement robust input validation for all console inputs. Validate that the input matches the expected format (e.g., 'Y' or 'N') before acting upon it. Handle invalid inputs gracefully to prevent exceptions and ensure proper program flow.
