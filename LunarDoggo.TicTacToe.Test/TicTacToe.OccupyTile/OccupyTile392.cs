   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test to validate successful tile occupation and player switching

Details:
  TestName: TestSuccessfulTileOccupationAndPlayerSwitching
  Description: This test is designed to validate whether a player can successfully occupy a tile and if the player is switched after the successful occupation.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock of the ButtonTileMapping class and provide it with a tile that isn't already occupied.
  Act: Invoke the OccupyTile method with the mocked ButtonTileMapping object.
  Assert: Verify that the OccupyTile method of the gameBoard object is called and the SwitchPlayer method is also called.

Validation:
  This assertion verifies that a player can successfully occupy a tile and the player is switched after a successful occupation. It validates the normal flow of the game where players take turns to occupy tiles.

Scenario 2: Test to validate unsuccessful tile occupation

Details:
  TestName: TestUnsuccessfulTileOccupation
  Description: This test is designed to verify the scenario where a player tries to occupy a tile that is already occupied.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock of the ButtonTileMapping class and provide it with a tile that is already occupied.
  Act: Invoke the OccupyTile method with the mocked ButtonTileMapping object.
  Assert: Verify that the TileAlreadyOccupied event is invoked.

Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the TileAlreadyOccupied event is invoked when a player tries to occupy a tile that is already occupied. It validates the game's rule that a tile cannot be occupied more than once.

Scenario 3: Test to validate game over due to a draw

Details:
  TestName: TestGameOverDueToDraw
  Description: This test is designed to validate the scenario where the game is over due to a draw.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the gameBoard to return true for the AreAllFieldsOccupied method and false for the HasWon method.
  Act: Invoke the OccupyTile method.
  Assert: Verify that the GameOverDraw event is invoked.

Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the GameOverDraw event is invoked when all tiles are occupied and no player has won. This validates the game's rule that declares a draw when all tiles are occupied and no player has won.

Scenario 4: Test to validate game over due to a player winning

Details:
  TestName: TestGameOverDueToPlayerWinning
  Description: This test is designed to validate the scenario where the game is over due to a player winning.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the gameBoard to return true for the HasWon method.
  Act: Invoke the OccupyTile method.
  Assert: Verify that the GameOverPlayerWon event is invoked.

Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the GameOverPlayerWon event is invoked when a player has won the game. It validates the game's rule that declares a player as the winner when they meet the winning conditions.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insufficient Input Validation
Issue: The code doesn't sufficiently validate the input in the OccupyTile method. A user could potentially provide invalid coordinates, leading to an IndexOutOfRangeException.
Solution: Add checks to ensure that the coordinates provided are within the valid range before accessing the gameBoard's tiles array.

Vulnerability: Potential Null Reference Exceptions
Issue: The code assumes that a ButtonTileMapping always exists for every tile. If a tile doesn't have a corresponding ButtonTileMapping, the Single method will throw an InvalidOperationException.
Solution: Add checks to ensure that a ButtonTileMapping exists before trying to access its properties. This can be done by using the SingleOrDefault method instead of Single, and then checking if the result is null before accessing its properties.
