   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Here are the NUnit test scenarios for the DoTick() method in the LunarDoggo.QuizGame namespace:

Scenario 1: DoTick_WhenGameIsNotStarted_ShouldDrawGameStart

Details:
  TestName: DoTickWhenGameIsNotStartedShouldDrawGameStart
  Description: This test checks if the DoTick method correctly draws the game start screen when the game is not yet started.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of GameLoop with a mocked IVisualizer and a list of QuizQuestion objects.
  Act: Call the DoTick method on the GameLoop instance.
  Assert: Verify that the DrawGameStart method of the mocked IVisualizer is called with the correct total question count.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the game start screen is displayed with the correct number of questions when the game is not started.
  This test is important to validate that the game begins with the appropriate visual representation.

Scenario 2: DoTick_WhenGameIsStartedAndHasUnansweredQuestions_ShouldDrawQuizQuestion

Details:
  TestName: DoTickWhenGameIsStartedAndHasUnansweredQuestionsShouldDrawQuizQuestion
  Description: This test verifies that the DoTick method correctly draws the current quiz question when the game is started and there are unanswered questions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of GameLoop with a mocked IVisualizer and a list of QuizQuestion objects. Set the game state to started.
  Act: Call the DoTick method on the GameLoop instance.
  Assert: Verify that the DrawQuizQuestion method of the mocked IVisualizer is called with the current question and the highlighted answer ID.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the current quiz question is displayed correctly with the highlighted answer when the game is in progress.
  This test ensures that the game presents the questions to the player as expected.

Scenario 3: DoTick_WhenCurrentQuestionIsAnswered_ShouldDrawAnswerStatus

Details:
  TestName: DoTickWhenCurrentQuestionIsAnsweredShouldDrawAnswerStatus
  Description: This test checks if the DoTick method correctly draws the answer status when the current question is answered.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of GameLoop with a mocked IVisualizer and a list of QuizQuestion objects. Set the game state to started and answer the current question.
  Act: Call the DoTick method on the GameLoop instance.
  Assert: Verify that the DrawAnswerStatus method of the mocked IVisualizer is called with the correct answer status and the correct answer.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the answer status is displayed correctly, indicating whether the chosen answer is correct or not.
  This test validates that the game provides feedback to the player about their answer choice.

Scenario 4: DoTick_WhenAllQuestionsAreAnswered_ShouldDrawGameResult

Details:
  TestName: DoTickWhenAllQuestionsAreAnsweredShouldDrawGameResult
  Description: This test verifies that the DoTick method correctly draws the game result when all questions are answered.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of GameLoop with a mocked IVisualizer and a list of QuizQuestion objects. Set the game state to started and answer all the questions.
  Act: Call the DoTick method on the GameLoop instance.
  Assert: Verify that the DrawGameResult method of the mocked IVisualizer is called with the total question count and the correct answers count.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the game result screen is displayed with the correct total question count and the number of correctly answered questions.
  This test ensures that the game concludes properly and presents the final result to the player.

Scenario 5: DoTick_WhenAllQuestionsAreAnswered_ShouldSetIsFinishedToTrue

Details:
  TestName: DoTickWhenAllQuestionsAreAnsweredShouldSetIsFinishedToTrue
  Description: This test checks if the DoTick method sets the IsFinished property to true when all questions are answered.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of GameLoop with a mocked IVisualizer and a list of QuizQuestion objects. Set the game state to started and answer all the questions.
  Act: Call the DoTick method on the GameLoop instance.
  Assert: Verify that the IsFinished property of the GameLoop instance is set to true.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the game loop correctly identifies when all questions are answered and sets the IsFinished flag accordingly.
  This test validates that the game loop terminates at the appropriate time.

Scenario 6: DoTick_WhenProcessInputThrowsException_ShouldHandleExceptionGracefully

Details:
  TestName: DoTickWhenProcessInputThrowsExceptionShouldHandleExceptionGracefully
  Description: This test verifies that the DoTick method handles exceptions thrown by the ProcessInput method gracefully and continues execution.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of GameLoop with a mocked IVisualizer and a list of QuizQuestion objects. Mock the ProcessInput method to throw an exception.
  Act: Call the DoTick method on the GameLoop instance.
  Assert: Verify that the DoTick method does not propagate the exception and continues execution.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the game loop does not crash or terminate abruptly when an exception occurs in the ProcessInput method.
  This test ensures the robustness and reliability of the game loop in handling unexpected errors.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the DoTick method, including game start, question display, answer status, game result, game loop termination, and error handling. They help ensure the correct behavior and visual representation of the game at different stages.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'ProcessInput' method directly uses the input from 'Console.ReadKey()' without any validation or sanitization. Malicious input could potentially cause unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure only expected key presses are processed. Sanitize the input before using it in the game logic.

Vulnerability: CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime
Issue: The 'ConsoleVisualizer' class sets 'Console.CursorVisible' to false in its constructor but does not restore it to its original state when the object is disposed. This can lead to resource leaks and unexpected behavior.
Solution: Implement the 'IDisposable' interface in the 'ConsoleVisualizer' class and properly restore the 'Console.CursorVisible' state in the 'Dispose' method.
