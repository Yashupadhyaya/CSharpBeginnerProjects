   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Here are the NUnit test scenarios for the DrawGameStart method in the ConsoleVisualizer class:

Scenario 1: DrawGameStart_WithSingleQuestion_DisplaysCorrectMessage

Details:
  TestName: DrawGameStartWithSingleQuestion_DisplaysCorrectMessage
  Description: This test verifies that the DrawGameStart method displays the correct message when there is only one question loaded.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ConsoleVisualizer.
  Act: Invoke the DrawGameStart method with totalQuestionCount set to 1.
  Assert: Verify that the console output contains the message "1 question was loaded, press "enter" to start the game."
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method correctly handles the singular form of "question" and "was" when there is only one question.
  This test is important to validate that the method provides accurate information to the user about the number of questions loaded.

Scenario 2: DrawGameStart_WithMultipleQuestions_DisplaysCorrectMessage

Details:
  TestName: DrawGameStartWithMultipleQuestions_DisplaysCorrectMessage
  Description: This test verifies that the DrawGameStart method displays the correct message when there are multiple questions loaded.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ConsoleVisualizer.
  Act: Invoke the DrawGameStart method with totalQuestionCount set to a value greater than 1 (e.g., 5).
  Assert: Verify that the console output contains the message "5 questions were loaded, press "enter" to start the game."
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method correctly handles the plural form of "questions" and "were" when there are multiple questions.
  This test is important to validate that the method provides accurate information to the user about the number of questions loaded.

Scenario 3: DrawGameStart_WithZeroQuestions_DisplaysCorrectMessage

Details:
  TestName: DrawGameStartWithZeroQuestions_DisplaysCorrectMessage
  Description: This test verifies that the DrawGameStart method displays the correct message when there are no questions loaded.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ConsoleVisualizer.
  Act: Invoke the DrawGameStart method with totalQuestionCount set to 0.
  Assert: Verify that the console output contains the message "0 questions were loaded, press "enter" to start the game."
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method correctly handles the case when there are no questions loaded.
  This test is important to validate that the method provides accurate information to the user even when there are no questions.

Scenario 4: DrawGameStart_ClearsConsole

Details:
  TestName: DrawGameStart_ClearsConsole
  Description: This test verifies that the DrawGameStart method clears the console before displaying the message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ConsoleVisualizer.
  Act: Invoke the DrawGameStart method with any valid totalQuestionCount.
  Assert: Verify that the console is cleared before the message is displayed.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method clears the console to provide a clean slate for displaying the game start message.
  This test is important to validate that the method maintains a clean user interface by clearing any previous output.

These test scenarios cover different aspects of the DrawGameStart method, including handling different numbers of questions (single, multiple, and zero) and clearing the console before displaying the message. They help ensure that the method behaves correctly and provides accurate information to the user under various circumstances.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The 'DrawQuizQuestion' method writes the 'question.Question' property directly to the console output without proper escaping or validation. If the question text contains any HTML or JavaScript code, it could lead to XSS attacks when displaying the quiz question.
Solution: Implement proper input validation and output encoding for the 'question.Question' property before writing it to the console. Use a library like Microsoft.Security.Application.Encoder to encode the output and prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The 'DrawNoQuestions' method prompts the user to enter questions into a JSON file located in the application's folder. If the file path is constructed using unsanitized user input, it could allow an attacker to traverse directories and access or modify unauthorized files.
Solution: Validate and sanitize any file paths or user input used to construct file paths. Use Path.GetFullPath to resolve relative paths and Path.GetFileName to extract only the file name. Restrict file access to a specific directory and ensure that the application has limited permissions.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'DrawPlayAgain' method prompts the user for input to determine whether to play again, but it does not validate or sanitize the user's response. This could allow an attacker to enter unexpected or malicious input, potentially leading to unintended behavior or security issues.
Solution: Implement strict input validation for user responses. Validate that the input matches the expected format (e.g., 'Y' or 'N') and sanitize the input to remove any potentially harmful characters. Use a whitelist approach to allow only specific valid responses.
